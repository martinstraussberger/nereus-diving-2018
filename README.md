## Project Nereus Diving Platform (Experience Unique Diving)
Welcome to the Nereus Diving project on Github! This project was born during my studies as a Software Engineer at the [Code University of Applied Sciences](https://code.berlin/en/) in Berlin. In 2018, I joined forces with two friends who later became my co-founding partners for Nereus Diving UG. We shared a passion for diving and the beautiful diving spots around the world, such as Pulau Tioman in Malaysia, Borneo in Indonesia, Tulum in Mexico, Sharm el Sheikh / Hurghada in Egypt, and Australia. We poured our hearts and minds into the project, iterating through design decisions and technology choices to develop a prototype.

Unfortunately, the project was greatly impacted by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as many countries closed their borders and diving centers shut down. We were forced to put our project on hold, but I am proud to have had the opportunity to develop a prototype within a short amount of time, using pure JS / CSS / HTML. Once our Beta-Tests have been finished the plans were using modern technologies such as React, TypeScript and MongoDB.

Even though we were unable to fully develop the platform, I am excited to share the prototype with the public as an early showcase of my Frontend Engineering career. Thank you for visiting and I hope you enjoy exploring the project!
